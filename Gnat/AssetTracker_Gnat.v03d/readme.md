Newly redesigned Gnat.v03d

Same basic design using the CMWX1ZZABZ-078 LoRaWAN module and MAX M8Q-0-10 GNSS engine. 
Replaced the LDOs with the super low Iq (25 nA) TPS7A031 and the wake-on-motion accelerometer with the LIS2DW12.

Design was created using Altium Designer so there is a step file with the design available for planning enclosures, etc.
