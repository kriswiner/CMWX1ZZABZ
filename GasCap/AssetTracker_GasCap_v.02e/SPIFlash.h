Sketch by Kris Winer December 16. 2016

License: Use this sketch any way you choose; if you like it, buy me a beer sometime

Purpose: Checks function of a variety of SPI NOR flash memory chips hosted by the STM32L4
Dragonfly (STM32L476), Butterfly (STM32L433), and Ladybug (STML432) development boards or their variants.

Sketch takes advantage of the SPI.beginTransaction/SPI.EndTransaction protocol for efficiency
and maximum speed.
